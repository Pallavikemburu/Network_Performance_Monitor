# Network_Performance_Monitor

Project Description: Network Performance Monitor

Overview:
The Network Performance Monitor is a robust application designed to track and analyze the performance of computer networks. It provides insights into key performance metrics, including bandwidth usage, latency, and error rates. This tool is essential for network administrators and IT professionals seeking to optimize network resources, identify bottlenecks, and ensure the reliability of their network infrastructure.

Key Features:

1. Real-Time Monitoring:
   - Continuously monitors network activity, capturing data on bytes sent and received at configurable intervals.

2. Latency Tracking:
   - Simulates latency measurements and tracks how quickly data is transmitted over the network, helping to identify potential delays in communication.

3. Error Rate Analysis:
   - Logs error rates during network usage to assess the reliability of the network and identify any persistent issues.

4. Data Logging:
   - Stores historical performance data for analysis, allowing users to observe trends over time and make informed decisions based on empirical evidence.

5. Report Generation:
   - Automatically generates performance reports that summarize the captured data, making it easier for users to understand their network's performance at a glance.

6. Data Visualization:
   - Utilizes Matplotlib to create graphical representations of bandwidth usage, latency, and error rates over time, enabling quick identification of patterns and anomalies.

Skills Used:
- Networking fundamentals (IP addressing, bandwidth usage, latency)
- Python programming
- Data visualization techniques with Matplotlib
- Performance monitoring concepts

Technologies:
- Python (with libraries such as psutil and Matplotlib)
- Command-line interface for user interaction
